# The following files are to realize a flexible IMS system following the concept originally reported by Smith et al. (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c01357).  These files represent the interpretation of the concept by Smith et al. but implemented at WSU.

Note: 
* Designs are currently in solidworks.  Should you not have access to this CAD platform, consider the use of OnShape for conversion to STL for printing or fabrication.
