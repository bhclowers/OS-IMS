Atmospheric Pressure Ion Mobility Design

The design files located in this repository comprise the working design files used for the atmospheric pressure ion mobility spectrometer operated at Washington State University (Dr. Brian Clowers) and Azuza Pacific University (Dr. Eric Davis). Periodic updates will be pushed as modifications are made.  A wiki will be populated for the next version of the system is constructed to provide other researchers with a detailed set of assembly instructions.
